# Tech & Finance Data Analytics (Python + SQL)
Analyzing revenue performance, customer behavior, financial risk indicators and operational trends. The project demonstrates end-to-end analytics using Python and SQL including data cleaning, exploratory analysis, KPI development and insight-driven visualizations designed for business decision-making.
 
## Objectives
- Build a clean, reproducible analytics workflow (data cleaning → analysis → visualization → insights)
- Use SQL to answer business questions and validate metrics
- Develop finance-focused KPIs (profit margin, growth rate, volatility) and customer KPIs (churn, ARPU, CLV)

## Tools & Tech
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- SQL (PostgreSQL/SQLite style)
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Matplotlib
- Git/GitHub

## Project Structure
- data/
    - raw/              # Original, unmodified datasets
    - processed/        # Cleaned and transformed datasets
- notebooks/            # Jupyter notebooks for analysis
- sql/                  # SQL queries for analytics
- visuals/              # Exported charts and dashboards
- insights/             # Business-facing summaries
- requirements.txt      # Python dependencies

## Key Analyses (Planned)
- Revenue growth by month/quarter
- Profit margin and cost-to-revenue trends
- Customer segmentation + churn analysis
- Risk indicators: margin compression, expense spikes, revenue volatility

## How to Run
1. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
   - `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run notebooks in order from `notebooks/01_...` onward.
