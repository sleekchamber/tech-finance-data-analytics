# Tech & Finance Data Analytics (Python + SQL)
This project analyzes revenue performance, customer behavior, financial risk indicators, and operational trends. The goal is to demonstrate end-to-end data analysis skills, from raw data cleaning to business insights and KPI reporting.
 
## Objectives
- Clean and preprocess raw financial and customer transaction data
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends and patterns
- Use SQL to answer business questions and validate metrics
- Calculate business-critical KPIs such as MRR, ARPU, churn, and profit margins
- Translate technical findings into executive-level insights

## Tools & Technologies
- Python: pandas, numpy, matplotlib
- SQL: Analytical queries using window functions and aggregations
- Jupyter Notebooks: Reproducible analysis
- GitHub: Version control and project documentation
